# Puppet pre-commit hook
# This hook, does three things
#   1. Check if a file to be commited contains non-ascii characters
#   2. Runs `puppet parser validate` on all files to be commited
#   3. Runs `puppet-lint` on all files to be commited
#   4. Check for trailing whitespace in files
#


# 1. Check if a file to be commited contains non-ascii characters

# Cross platform projects tend to avoid non-ASCII filenames; prevent
# them from being added to the repository. We exploit the fact that the
# printable range starts at the space character and ends with tilde.
if [ "$allownonascii" != "true" ] &&
	# Note that the use of brackets around a tr range is ok here, (it's
	# even required, for portability to Solaris 10's /usr/bin/tr), since
	# the square bracket bytes happen to fall in the designated range.
	test $(git diff --cached --name-only --diff-filter=A -z \

Error: Attempt to add a non-ASCII file name.
This can cause problems if you want to work with people on other platforms.
To be portable it is advisable to rename the file.
If you know what you are doing you can disable this check using:
  git config hooks.allownonascii true
